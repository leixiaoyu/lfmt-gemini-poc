# LFMT Implementation Plan v2.0 - CI/CD & Git Integration

## Updates from v1.0
- **Git version control integration** throughout development process
- **CI/CD pipeline implementation** for automated testing and deployment  
- **Verification-first approach** with actual AWS deployment validation
- **Enhanced quality gates** with automated deployment validation

## Implementation Philosophy (Enhanced)
- **Spec-Driven**: Every component must match its low-level design specification exactly
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation to validate against specifications
- **Git-Flow**: All changes tracked with meaningful commits and pull requests
- **Deploy-Early**: Deploy to AWS immediately with CI/CD for rapid feedback
- **Verify-Always**: Automated verification of deployments and functionality
- **Human-Reviewable**: Clear milestones and deliverables with PR-based reviews

## Phase 0: Foundation Setup (NEW)
**Duration**: 1 day
**Priority**: CRITICAL

### Milestone 0.1: Git Repository & Version Control
**Tasks:**
1. Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore
2. Set up Git hooks for pre-commit validation
3. Create initial commit with current project state
4. Set up branch protection rules and naming conventions
5. Configure commit message standards

### Milestone 0.2: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
**Tasks:**
1. Choose CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions recommended)
2. Create deployment workflows for dev/staging/prod
3. Set up AWS credentials and secrets management
4. Create automated testing pipeline
5. Configure deployment approval processes

### Milestone 0.3: Initial AWS Deployment
**Tasks:**
1. Deploy infrastructure to dev environment
2. Verify all AWS resources are created correctly
3. Run post-deployment validation tests
4. Document deployment outputs and configuration
5. Set up monitoring and alerting

## Enhanced Development Workflow

### Git Workflow Standards

#### Branch Strategy
```
main/
├── develop/
│   ├── feature/auth-system
│   ├── feature/document-chunking  
│   ├── feature/gemini-integration
│   └── hotfix/security-patch
└── release/
    ├── v1.0.0
    └── v1.1.0
```

#### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
Scopes: auth, docs, api, ui, infra, deploy
```

#### Example Commits
```bash
feat(infra): add DynamoDB tables for job state management

- Create jobs table with GSI for user queries
- Add attestations table with 7-year TTL
- Configure encryption and point-in-time recovery
- Add comprehensive infrastructure tests

Closes: #123
Refs: Document-7-Job-State-Management
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

#### Pipeline Stages
1. **Validate** → Lint, type-check, unit tests
2. **Build** → Compile TypeScript, bundle assets
3. **Test** → Integration tests, security scans
4. **Deploy Dev** → Automatic deployment to development
5. **Test E2E** → End-to-end validation in dev environment
6. **Deploy Staging** → Manual approval required
7. **Deploy Prod** → Manual approval + additional validations

#### Quality Gates
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
quality_gates:
  code_coverage: 95%
  security_scan: pass
  infrastructure_tests: pass
  integration_tests: pass
  performance_tests: pass
```

- [x] ~~Infrastructure validation tests~~ ✅ COMPLETED  
- [ ] **Deploy to AWS dev environment** ⚠️ PENDING
- [ ] **Verify all resources created correctly** ⚠️ PENDING
- [ ] **Run post-deployment validation** ⚠️ PENDING
- [ ] **Configure environment variables** ⚠️ PENDING

#### Milestone 1.2: Authentication System (3 days)
- [ ] Lambda functions for user registration/login
- [ ] JWT token management implementation
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Comprehensive authentication tests
- [ ] **Deploy and verify in AWS** ⚠️ CRITICAL

### Phase 2-5: Unchanged Structure (with CI/CD integration)
- All subsequent phases follow the same structure as v1.0
- Each milestone includes **mandatory AWS deployment and verification**
- All changes go through PR review process
- Automated testing and deployment validation

## Information Required from User

### 1. CI/CD Platform Choice
**Options:**
