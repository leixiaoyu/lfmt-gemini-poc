## Date: 2025-10-09

### Summary

This document summarizes the progress made on the `lfmt-gemini-poc` project.

### Current Status

*   The AWS infrastructure for the `dev` environment has been successfully deployed.
*   The core infrastructure, including DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, and a Cognito User Pool, is in place.
*   The backend for the authentication service (Sprint 1) has been fully implemented and tested locally.
*   The initial frontend components for the authentication service have been created, including:
    *   `Register.tsx`
    *   `Login.tsx`
    *   `ResetPassword.tsx`
    *   `authService.ts` to handle API calls.
    *   Basic routing has been set up in `App.tsx`.

### Next Steps

The next step is to run the frontend application locally to test the new authentication components and their integration with the backend.
