# LFMT-GEMINI-POC Execution Plan (v2)

This document outlines the plan to build and deliver the Long-Form Translation Service. This revised plan emphasizes a more agile, feature-sliced approach with continuous integration and deployment.

## Core Principles

*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** All new code will be accompanied by tests.
*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Every push to the main branch will be deployed to a development environment.
*   **Vertical Slicing:** We will build and deliver features end-to-end, from the UI to the backend.
*   **Security by Design:** Security will be a consideration in every phase, not an afterthought.

## Sprint 0: Foundation and CI/CD (3-4 days) - âœ… COMPLETE

**Goal:** Establish a rock-solid foundation for the project. This is the most critical phase.

1.  **Fix `backend/infrastructure` Tests:**
    *   Properly configure Jest and TypeScript in the `backend/infrastructure` package.
    *   Ensure all existing infrastructure tests pass.
2.  **Enhance CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Configure the GitHub Actions workflow to run all tests (including the now-fixed infrastructure tests) on every push.
    *   Set up a deployment step to automatically deploy the infrastructure to a `dev` environment on AWS when code is merged to the `main` branch.
3.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   Set up AWS Secrets Manager for storing sensitive information like API keys.
    *   Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for non-sensitive configuration.
4.  **Initial AWS Deployment:**
    *   Execute the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the initial infrastructure to the `dev` environment.
    *   Verify that all resources are created correctly in the AWS console.

**Definition of Done:** The `main` branch is protected, all tests are passing in CI, and the infrastructure is successfully deployed to a `dev` environment.

## Sprint 1: User Authentication (3-4 days) - In Progress

**Status:** The backend is complete. The initial frontend components have been created. The next step is to test the frontend locally and complete the UI.

**Goal:** Implement a fully functional and secure user authentication system.

1.  **Backend (TDD):**
    *   **Tests:** Write unit and integration tests for user registration, login, token refresh, and password reset.
    *   **Implementation:** Implement the corresponding Lambda functions using AWS Cognito.
2.  **Frontend (TDD):**
    *   **Tests:** Write component tests for the login, registration, and password reset forms.
    *   **Implementation:** Build the UI components and integrate them with the authentication backend.
3.  **Security:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Implement secure handling of JWTs in the frontend.
4.  **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the authentication service to the `dev` environment and conduct end-to-end testing.

**Definition of Done:** Users can register, log in, and reset their password in the `dev` environment.

## Sprint 2: File Upload and Validation (3-4 days)

**Goal:** Allow users to upload documents for translation.

1.  **Backend (TDD):**
    *   **Tests:** Write tests for generating pre-signed S3 URLs and for validating uploaded files (size, type, word count).
    *   **Implementation:** Create the Lambda functions for file management.
2.  **Frontend (TDD):**
    *   **Tests:** Write tests for the file upload component, including drag-and-drop and validation feedback.
    *   **Implementation:** Build the file upload UI and integrate it with the backend.
3.  **Security:**
    *   Implement server-side validation of file types and sizes to prevent malicious uploads.
    *   Ensure that uploaded files are stored securely in S3 with appropriate access controls.
4.  **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the file upload feature to the `dev` environment and test the end-to-end flow.

**Definition of Done:** Users can upload a valid text file and receive confirmation that it has been accepted for translation.

## Sprint 3: Core Translation Workflow (5-7 days)

**Goal:** Implement the core translation pipeline.

1.  **Backend (TDD):**
    *   **Tests:** Write unit tests for the document chunking, Gemini API integration (with mocking), and document assembly Lambdas.
    *   **Implementation:** Implement the core logic for the translation workflow.
    *   **Step Functions:** Define and implement the Step Functions state machine to orchestrate the workflow.
2.  **Frontend (TDD):**
    *   **Tests:** Write tests for the job progress tracking component.
    *   **Implementation:** Build the UI to display the status of a translation job, using adaptive polling to fetch updates.
3.  **NFRs:**
    *   **Performance:** Benchmark the translation workflow and identify any performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Cost:** Implement cost tracking for each translation job.
4.  **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the translation workflow to the `dev` environment. Test with a small document to verify the end-to-end process.

**Definition of Done:** A user can upload a document, and it will be successfully translated and reassembled. The user can see the progress of the translation in the UI.

## Sprint 4: User Dashboard and History (3-4 days)

**Goal:** Provide users with a way to view their translation history.

1.  **Backend (TDD):**
    *   **Tests:** Write tests for the API endpoints that retrieve a user's translation history.
    *   **Implementation:** Create the Lambda functions to query DynamoDB for the user's jobs.
2.  **Frontend (TDD):**
    *   **Tests:** Write tests for the user dashboard components.
    *   **Implementation:** Build the UI to display a list of past translations with their status and allow users to download the results.
3.  **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the user dashboard to the `dev` environment and test the full feature.

**Definition of Done:** A user can view a list of their past and current translation jobs on a dashboard.

## Sprint 5: Production Readiness (3-4 days)

**Goal:** Prepare the application for a production release.

1.  **Security Review:**
    *   Conduct a thorough security review of the entire application, including all infrastructure, backend, and frontend code.
    *   Perform vulnerability scanning and address any identified issues.
2.  **Load Testing:**
    *   Use a tool like Artillery or k6 to load-test the API and identify any performance bottlenecks under load.
3.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Set up comprehensive CloudWatch dashboards for monitoring key application metrics.
    *   Configure CloudWatch alarms to alert the team of any issues.
4.  **Final Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the application to a `staging` environment for final testing.
    *   Deploy to the `production` environment.

**Definition of Done:** The application is deployed to production, is stable under load, and has comprehensive monitoring in place.

This updated plan provides a more robust and agile path to delivering a high-quality product. I am ready to begin with Sprint 0. Shall I proceed?
